<h1>Business Problem</h1>

You are working as a data scientist with the analytics vertical of this company, focused on profiling the best companies and job positions to work for from the this company database. You are provided with the information for a segment of learners and tasked to cluster them on the basis of their job profile, company, and other features. Ideally, these clusters should have similar characteristics

<h1>Concept Used</h1>

- PCA
- Manual Clustering
- Unsupervised Clustering - K- means, Hierarchical Clustering

### Project Goal

The goal of this project is to conduct comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), perform data preprocessing including handling missing values and feature engineering, execute manual clustering based on company, job position, and years of experience, apply unsupervised learning techniques for clustering, and derive actionable insights and recommendations for business decisions.

### Objective

To analyze a dataset encompassing employee information, focusing on exploring relationships, identifying patterns through clustering techniques, and providing actionable insights for strategic decision-making in HR and business operations.

### Recommendations

1. Implement robust data preprocessing techniques including mean and KNN imputation, regex cleaning for company names, and standardization/encoding for machine learning readiness.
2. Utilize manual clustering to create meaningful flags such as Designation, Class, and Tier based on salary comparisons within companies and job categories.
3. Apply unsupervised learning methods like K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering to uncover distinct employee groups and clustering tendencies.
4. Derive actionable insights such as identifying top performers, benchmarking company performance based on CTC, and optimizing HR strategies based on clustering results.

### Data-Driven

The project emphasizes a data-driven approach to:

- Validate assumptions and hypotheses through statistical analysis and visual exploration.
- Utilize machine learning techniques to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within employee data.
- Provide evidence-based recommendations for HR policies, employee engagement strategies, and organizational efficiency.

### Audience

This project is targeted towards HR professionals, business analysts, and stakeholders interested in leveraging data-driven insights to optimize workforce management, enhance employee satisfaction, and improve organizational performance.

### Key Questions Explored

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

   - Conducting thorough inspection of dataset structure, identifying data types, and handling missing values.
   - Utilizing statistical summaries and visualizations (e.g., distribution plots, box plots) to understand data distributions and identify outliers.
   - Investigating relationships between variables through bivariate analysis to uncover insights into employee attributes and behaviors.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:

   - Implementing mean and KNN imputation techniques to handle missing values effectively.
   - Utilizing regular expressions (regex) for cleaning company names and ensuring data uniformity.
   - Performing feature engineering to derive new variables such as 'Years of Experience' and 'Designation Flags' based on aggregations and conditions.

3. **Manual Clustering**:

   - Creating flags such as 'Designation', 'Class', and 'Tier' based on salary comparisons within companies and job categories.
   - Applying business logic to classify employees into distinct groups for further analysis and strategic insights.

4. **Unsupervised Learning - Clustering**:

   - Assessing clustering tendencies and determining the optimal number of clusters using techniques like the Elbow method.
   - Implementing K-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms to segment employees based on salary patterns and job attributes.
   - Visualizing clustering results to interpret groupings and understand employee distribution across different clusters.

5. **Model Evaluation and Interpretation**:

   - Evaluating logistic regression models to predict loan defaults and assessing model performance using metrics like ROC AUC, precision-recall curves, and classification reports.
   - Interpreting model coefficients to understand the impact of predictor variables on loan status and identifying significant factors influencing default risk.

6. **Actionable Insights and Recommendations**:

   - Deriving actionable insights such as identifying top-performing employees, benchmarking company salary structures, and optimizing HR strategies based on clustering results.
   - Providing strategic recommendations for improving employee retention, enhancing performance incentives, and aligning HR policies with organizational goals.

7. **Business Application**:
   - Applying findings to real-world scenarios in HR management, talent acquisition, and organizational development.
   - Using data-driven insights to drive business decisions, improve operational efficiency, and achieve competitive advantages in the market.

These concepts collectively enable a comprehensive analysis of employee data, fostering informed decision-making and strategic planning within organizations aiming to optimize workforce management and enhance organizational performance.
